🧠 Project Context: Crowd Prop – Performance-Based Promotion Marketplace

Crowd Prop is a performance-based marketplace connecting two roles:

- Advertisers (companies/startups) who want to promote their product, brand, or sales
- Promoters (freelancers/influencers/sellers) who drive traffic, create content, or close sales and earn money for it

💼 Application Purpose

- Advertisers can publish visibility, marketing, or sales-based campaigns
- Promoters can explore offers, apply, or accept contracts and earn based on results (clicks, sales, reach)

🔗 Tracking Logic
- When a promoter accepts a campaign, a unique link like /r/abc123 is created
- A redirect server logs IP + fingerprint and validates if it's a unique view/sale
- If valid, logs it and redirects user to original advertiser URL (302)

🎯 Goal
A powerful yet simple marketplace where visibility and performance are tracked, and everyone is paid fairly based on their impact — with automated, secure infrastructure.
