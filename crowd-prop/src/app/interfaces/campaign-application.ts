/*          EXPLANATION:

This interface represents a Promoter’s application to a Campaign — usually for campaigns that require manual selection (CONSULTANT or SELLER types).

⚠️ It's only used when applicationRequired = true, meaning the advertiser manually selects a promoter based on their pitch or portfolio.

🧠 Real-World Use Cases
1. 🎯 Promoter applies to a Consultant or Seller campaign
They submit an application via a form:

✍️ A custom pitch

💼 A portfolio link

💰 A proposed quote

📎 Optional file attachments (e.g., sample videos, PDFs)

→ This creates a CampaignApplication object.

2. 👀 Advertiser reviews the applications
Advertisers can:

View pitch and portfolio

See attached files

Review the proposed quote

Check availability notes

They can then accept or reject the application.

3. 💬 Communication via messaging
If your platform includes a messaging system, the application can be linked to a chat thread using messageThreadId, allowing:

Pre-selection discussions

Negotiations

Clarifications on deliverables or timing
