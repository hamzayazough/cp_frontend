# Promoter Dashboard API Documentation

This document outlines the API endpoints that need to be implemented on the backend to support the Promoter Dashboard functionality.

## Base URL

All endpoints are relative to your API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api` or `https://your-domain.com/api`)

## Wallet & Earnings Structure

The promoter wallet system handles two distinct earning types:

### View Earnings (Accumulated)

- **Accumulation**: Earnings from view-based campaigns accumulate in the wallet
- **Minimum Threshold**: $20 minimum required before withdrawal
- **Payout Schedule**: Monthly payouts at the end of each month
- **Status**: `currentBalance` (withdrawable) vs `pendingBalance` (under threshold)

### Direct Earnings (Immediate)

- **Payment Method**: Consultant and salesman earnings go directly to bank account
- **Timing**: Paid when campaign is completed
- **No Accumulation**: Bypasses the wallet system entirely

### Transaction Flow

1. **View Campaigns**: Earnings → Wallet → Monthly Payout → Bank
2. **Consultant/Salesman**: Earnings → Direct Bank Transfer

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <firebase_jwt_token>
```

## Endpoints

## Performance Recommendations

1. **Use the combined dashboard endpoint** (`POST /promoter/dashboard`) for the main dashboard view to minimize API calls
2. **Implement proper caching** for frequently accessed data like stats and campaigns
3. **Use pagination** for large datasets (transactions, messages, campaigns)
4. **Add database indexing** on frequently queried fields (userId, campaignId, dates)
5. **Consider real-time updates** for critical data like earnings and messages using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

## Security Considerations

1. **Validate all user inputs** to prevent injection attacks
2. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
3. **Use proper authorization** to ensure promoters can only access their own data
4. **Log all financial transactions** for audit purposes
5. **Encrypt sensitive data** in transit and at rest
